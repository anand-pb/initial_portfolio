    <p align="justify"><em><strong>I have always been fascinated by ‘artistic expressions’,</strong> but as I heard the word <strong>‘Innovation’</strong> (the first time, from my dad, I was in 7th grade), I never thought that the creation of both came from the same part of the brain, and how artistic expressions are the innovations of polity. years later, I skimmed through geo-polity and geo-biology out of curiosity and learned to see how shaky are the so-called constants.<br><br> <strong>this drove me towards an explorative attitude</strong> as the changing landscapes that humans have created is real only until the validity of the consensus. speaking of consensus, that’s where I was enthralled by the significance of communications and conversations that have built this place, we live in. My fascination towards ‘artistic expressions’ reached new heights when I could see how such conversations have solved and would solve pressing problems. so, I was so interested to learn diverse artforms and so, practised and performed those at all opportunities both within school and out to other schools as well. for every event that would happen I try my best to put atleast one performance (mostly, a team performance), this led me to be on stage for a much longer time and got accustomed to collaborate and address cohorts. I would dance, play keyboard, sing, do mimicry, do beat box, sketch cartoons, paint, write plays and mimes, do graphic design and write poetry.<br><br> I converted a paint warehouse into a science lab and collect artefacts that felt ‘scientific’ and talk about those artefacts to those who were similarly interested, I would also play an obsessive amount of basketball and badminton along with football and table tennis. so, as I had this diverse interests and interesting conversations as a consequence, <strong>I gathered a team of such driven minds and tried to collaborate with them and make conversations that would not happen on itself</strong>, I was blown away to see how interesting would those conversations be between an aspiring mechanical engineer and an aspiring architect, between a chartered accountant and communications engineer, between a law student and a communications engineer, and further more combinations. I tried to create systems to have learning as an obvious consequence and it did transform into a hub of consequential perspectives. the explorative attitude gave the ability to see things in insightful angles and <strong>made the process of solving problems interesting’</strong></em></p>
